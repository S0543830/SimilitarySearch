<h3>HOOPS Exchange Introduction</h3>

<p>HOOPS Exchange is a toolkit to empower development teams with the best translation solutions available.These can be used individually or together to provide an expansive framework for development.</p>

<p>HOOPS Exchange enables applications to access data from all major 3D CAD software. It fully supports the latest versions of both proprietary and open data formats.</p>

<p>New users are encouraged to start by reading the documentation which is contained in the /documentation.exchange directory. Specifically, you should load index.html into your web browser and read the 'Technical Overview' guides which are great starting points as you try to orient yourself with our technology.</p>

<p>For a closer understanding of the APIs, you can review the source code samples provided. The samples are located in the <span  class="filename">\samples\</span> directory. The top-level solution file <span class="filename">exchange.sln</span> allows you to build all the projects. Please note that the samples will not work unless you have a valid license key set in your code.</p>

<p>You can obtain this license key from the HOOPS Developer Zone on the same page as you downloaded the HOOPS Exchange media. The license generator will require you to provide your Eventum username and password. You will be able to create an Eventum username and password once you have signed a HOOPS Exchange evaluation agreement. The license key will work for 60 days after which the samples will stop working. Once you have licensed HOOPS Exchange you will be provided with a permanent, non-expiring license key. The license key should be set in this header file: <span class="filename">\include\A3DSDKLicenseKey.h</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have any problems with the HOOPS Exchange media don't hesitate to contact us at support@techsoft3d.com.</p>

<p>Have Fun!</p>

<p>-The HOOPS Exchange Team</p>

<h4>License Conditions</h4>
The FreeType 2 font engine is copyrighted work and cannot be used
legally without a software license. In order to make this project
usable to a vast majority of developers, we distribute it under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

- The FreeType License, found in the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
you to explicitly cite the FreeType project in your product's
documentation. All details are in the license file. This license
is suited to products which don't use the GNU General Public
License.
- The GNU General Public License version 2, found in `GPL.TXT' (any
later version can be used also), for programs which already use the
GPL. Note that the FTL is incompatible with the GPL due to its
advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar to that
of the X Window System. It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

The FreeType Project LICENSE
============================

2006-Jan-27

Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



Introduction
------------

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and
which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license
affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG
(Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion
and use of free software in commercial and freeware products
alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or
full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use
it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
somewhere in your documentation that you have used the
FreeType code. (`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this
software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and
assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a
credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus
encourage you to use the following text:

"""
Portions of this software are copyright <year> The FreeType
Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
"""

Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally
distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
beta or final release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the original
FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its
original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by
this license, you must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,
Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as
specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO
USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and
sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code
forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to
authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
herein, subject to the following conditions:

o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
(`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to
the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered,
original files must be preserved in all copies of source
files.

o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
states that the software is based in part of the work of the
FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also
encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your
documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on
the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use
our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid
to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use
the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
purposes without specific prior written permission.

We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation
or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',
`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have not signed this license, you are not required to
accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted
material, only this license, or another one contracted with the
authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.
Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType
Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

o freetype@nongnu.org

Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
future and wanted additions to the library and distribution.
If you are looking for support, start in this list if you
haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,
specific licenses, porting, etc.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

Version 1.01e, February 12th, 2005
Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant
This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe. The
whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
(Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt. This
file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
version without encryption capabilities).
If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.
