HOOPS Exchange is a toolkit to empower development teams with the best translation 
solutions available. These can be used individually or together to provide an 
expansive framework for development.

HOOPS Exchange enables applications to access data from all major 3D CAD software. It
fully supports the latest versions of both proprietary and open data formats.

New users are encouraged to start by reading the documentation which is contained in 
the /documentation.exchange directory. Specifically, you should load index.html into 
your web browser and read the 'Technical Overview' guides which are great starting 
points as you try to orient yourself with our technology.

For a closer understanding of the APIs, you can review the source code samples provided.
The samples are located in the \samples\ directory. The top-level solution file 
exchange.sln allows you to build all the projects. Please note that the samples will 
not work unless you have a valid license key set in your code.

You can obtain this license key from the HOOPS Developer Zone on the same page as you 
downloaded the HOOPS Exchange media. The license generator will require you to provide 
your Eventum username and password. You will be able to create an Eventum username 
and password once you have signed a HOOPS Exchange evaluation agreement. The license 
key will work for 60 days after which the samples will stop working. Once you have 
licensed HOOPS Exchange you will be provided with a permanent, non-expiring license 
key. The license key should be set in this header file: \include\A3DSDKLicenseKey.h.

Finally, if you have any problems with the HOOPS Exchange media don't hesitate to 
contact us at support@techsoft3d.com.

Have Fun!
